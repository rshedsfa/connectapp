hi, my name is rshed and i work as a high school teacher in palestine. this in my cs50 final project. i decide to create a useful app to my school to help students and teachers and parents to easy communicate.

communication is very important in the school comunnty (teachers, student, and paraents) to pass information, statments, qoustions about the education process.

my app will solve 2 important problems in communcation field.
1-  first problem is lack of comunication because of each side not has the number of the other side.
2- scound problem is fact that to comunicate thrwo whttsapp user need to save the number in contacts to be able to strat chat.

in small scale it seems a small problem but in big scals like my school it is a huge problem. in my school there is about 1,000 students and 2,000 parents and 100 teacher & emplye. in the daily basis teacher need to contact new students and parets and the opposite is true. every time they need to requst the number from each other and after the responce (that may take houers or days) they need to save the number to send a simpele message. that is so hard and exhausted. that reduces the communication to the minimum.

but not any more becase with my app user can reach to the other user in the school comunnty  and start call or whttsapp chat with less than 10 seconds.

in the main page appear contact information about each student and his parents as a buttons. the app let users to call each other by regular call or whttsapp. user can easy trigger the switch button in the main page to convert buttons (green is whttsapp mode, blue is regular call mode). also teachers can add/update/delete users easly.

the app has a lot of potential for devlopment and can be apply in other institutions and organizations.
